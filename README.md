# tripleten-projects
Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that I developed during the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp. Each one of them represents the conclusion of a sprint on a specific study topic. These projects make use of machine learning concepts, Python, and popular libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn. The code for each project is organized in Jupyter Notebooks.
